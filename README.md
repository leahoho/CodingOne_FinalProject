**🌌 Project Description**

Fantasy Galaxy is an imaginary space inspired by NASA. In 2020, a NASA intern discovered a new planet, 1300 light-years away from earth. An illustration also showed what scientists think the planet might look like - a stunning pink gradient planet. This founding also inspired me to discover many unknowns we haven’t discovered yet in this space. It maybe has a playground out there we didn’t know. I always imagine some aliens will build a theme park in outer space, just like Disneyland in our world. 

Additionally, they don’t need a roller coaster to experience the excitement as they already can use a spaceship to travel around the universe. Besides, all the playful facilities need to be floated in space without gravity. Therefore, I think they may be just creating entertaining objects floating in the galaxy and just for fun, just like we feel joyful when watching a firework. 

In order that I created different geometry by using three.js,  it floating around the planet to create a playful atmosphere in the space. Also, generate a skybox galaxy scene with three.js and add a Disneyland soundtrack with Maximilian to make it feel like a fantasy and playful playground in the galaxy. Moreover, the overall colour tone uses pink as the primary colour to create illusion and match the colour with the new planet that NASA discovered. 

The most challenging part of this project is to use for loop to create a random shape all over the galaxy. After that, the geometry seems a bit off-shape and not in a three dimensions shape. Furthermore,  this is my first attempt to create 3D graphics using programming. I still explore and learn how to build a more complex 3D world. But I would like to develop more of this project in the future. I wish to add a UFO travel around the galaxy and facilities on top of the planet to construct an entire theme park in the universe. Hope the outcome can guide the audience to imagine what else we uncovered in this universe.
